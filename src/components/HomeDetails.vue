          I studied Computer Science in Dublin. From the computer science side I learnt about Data Structures, Algorithms, Frameworks, HTML, CSS and Javascript (to name a few). 
          This gave me a solid foundation for writing reusable, maintainable, modular and robust code. The course also had a design module where I learnt about Neilsons Hierarchy of needs
          Design Principles, Color Theory, Grids and the invisible 'rules' that govern compelling design.

          I have always worked on hobby projects. One of my latest *simplecss.eu* was sold for profit in 2018 after it started to gain more regular traffic which I monetised using 
          Google Adsense and a mailing list of a few thousand users. *Talk about other key accomplishments*. Promotion? Owner of Guild? Asked to Travel to Madrid to shape the team

          I worked in a small Digital Asset Management *http://visualid.com/* company straight after college where I worked as the Front-end developer and gained valuable industry experience.
          Next I was hired as the Lead UI Developer at Accenture in the center of innovation in Dublin. Despite company policy on promotions, they promoted me to Lead UI Developer 8 months 
          into the job.
